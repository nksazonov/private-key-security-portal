  description: `In modern blockchain account protection practices, two main security strategies have emerged. The first strategy involves directly protecting the user's private key - taking measures that prevent unauthorized access to the key itself or its loss. The second strategy involves applying an additional layer of security on top of the basic account level, particularly through specialized mechanisms of cryptocurrency wallets or smart contracts.

  Loss or compromise of a private key inevitably leads to loss of access to assets, making reliable key storage one of the central issues in cryptocurrency system security. Users must ensure not only protection of the key from unauthorized access but also guarantee the possibility of its recovery in case of accidental loss or damage to the storage medium.`,

* High level of security due to hardware isolation.
* The key never leaves the device, making it impossible to steal.`,
      disadvantages: `**Disadvantages:**

* Inconvenient to use: to sign transactions, the user needs to connect the device and physically press buttons.
* Need to use special software tools to work with the device.
* High cost of hardware.
* Possibility of loss or physical damage to the device.`,
