    description: `Ensuring a cryptographically secure level of entropy is a prerequisite for generating a reliable private key. According to the recommendations in **RFC 4086** and **NIST SP 800-90B**, a randomness source must have properties of unpredictability and resistance to reconstruction of previous and future outputs.

In web environments, it's advisable to combine pointer movements, timing microdiscrepancies, and WebRTC noise as the primary entropy pool. This pool, after post-processing (for example, through the cryptographic hash function SHA-256), initializes a deterministic CSPRNG â€“ achieving both high speed and strong guarantees of randomness.`,

      description: `The most common and straightforward method for generating private keys is to use a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG), the output of which either directly becomes the private key or is transformed into one using a hash function.

Below is an example of generating a private key and address using a CSPRNG that uses mouse movements as entropy. Try moving your mouse, generate the key again, and check if it has changed.`,
